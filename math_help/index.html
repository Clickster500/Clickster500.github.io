        <span class="bigger">Arithmetic</span>
        <p align="justify">
            Arithmetic is the elementary field of mathematics which concerns the study and use of the traditional operations (+, -, ร, รท) on numbers.
            Familiarity with arithmetic is necessary to do any form of traditional mathematics, as well as to build intuitions for more advanced fields (including those which redefine these operations).
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            The problems in this category are meant to be warm-ups and focus on only the first three operators with small numbers.
            Because of this, the advice in this section is directed towards doing these problems quickly in your head, since it is expected that you could solve these on paper.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>1. What is: a + b?</b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            The simplest method is just to add one digit at a time, from right to left. This is how addition is traditionally taught and will work every time.
            However, when a pair of digits adds up to 10 or more, some people find it easier to rearrange the numbers before adding.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            For example, in 39 + 115, I find it easier to "move" 1 and think of it as 40 + 114, which is much simpler.
            I could give more examples, but the only thing that helps build intuition and speed is practice.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>2. What is: a - b?</b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Since this is an introduction, the value b will always be equal to a or smaller than a. This means that the solution will be nonnegative (i.e., postive or zero).
            The strategy for this problem is merely an extension of the previous one.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            For example, in 93 - 48, I find it easier to "move" 2 and think of it as 91 - 50, which is much simpler.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>3. What is: a * b?</b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Since b is at most 10, this problem just requires you to know single digit times tables and to then do an easy addition problem.
            The only trick I use is for multiplying by 9.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            For example, in 25 * 9, I would multiply by 10 then substract the original value, 250 - 25, which I find simpler.
        </p>

        <span class="bigger">Algebra I</span>
        <p align="justify">
            Algebra introduces the concept of variables and describes how they can be manipulated within formulas.
            This abstraction is incredibly useful and thus it unifies practically every field of mathematics and is helpful in everyday life.
            This section is titled "Algebra I" after the course typically taught in American (junior) high schools which covers these concepts.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>1. Solve for x:&emsp; a(x + b) = c</b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            This is the first problem to introduce an equation. Equations are distinct from expressions because they have an equality sign (=).
            While an expression can only be simplified or rearraged, an equation can be solved to find new information about one or more of the terms.
            In this case, we can determine the value of x by doing the same operations to each side of the equation.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            If we know that d = 3, it is easy to see that d+1 = 3+1. Similarly, we can see that 2*d = 2*3.
            Now, let us consider an example equation: 3(x+7) = 12. 
        </p>


        <p align="justify">
            Since the 3 is multiplying the entire term on the left, we should divide by 3 first.
            This gives us x+7 = 4. Now, we simply subtract 7 from each side to get our answer, x = -3.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>2. Evaluate when x=a:&emsp; x(bx + c)</b>
        </p>
        
        <p align="justify">
            This problem asks us to simplify an expression by giving us information about one of the terms in the expression.
            In this case, we know the value of x and want to simplify the expression to a single value.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Consider x(2x + 5) when x=4. All we need to do is replace x with the value we know it is equal to, then simplify.
            That is, we take 4(2*4 + 5) and simplify one piece at a time. First, to 4(8 + 5), then to 4(13), and finally to 52.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
            <b>3. Slope and y-intercept</b>
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            One other key idea in algebra is that variables can be treated as either dependent or independent.
            A dependent variable usually depends on some function that involves an independent variable.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Imagine if we added a second variable to the previous problem and set it equal to the expression. This would give us y = x(2x + 5).
            In this case, we have not been given a value of x. Therefore, we could imagine x being equal to any arbitrary value.
            For example, we could calculate what the value of y would be if x=4. As shown above, this is 52.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            Now let's imagine a much simpler equation: y = 3x + 2. This is plotted below in standard Cartesian coordinates.
            The term "y-intercept" refers to the y-value at the point where the line touches the y-axis (vertical).
        </p>

        <img src="algebra_plot.png">

        <p align="justify">
            It is clear from point A on the plot that this value is 2.
            But what do we know about x when the line "touches" the y-axis? We know that x must be 0 at that point, regardless of the intial equation.
            Therefore, we can set x=0 and solve for y to get the answer directly. In this example, we can see that y = 3*0 + 2, or y = 2, as expected.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            For an equation representing a straight line (as in this problem), the slope measures how steep the line is.
            More specifically, given two points A and B, the slope is equal to how much the y-value changes divided by how much the x-value changes.
            As is seen in the plot, the change in y-value is equal to 5-2 and the change in x-value is equal to 1-0. Therefore, the slope is 3/1, or 3.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
            As you may have noticed, this value also appears in the original equation, y = 3x + 2. This is because the equation is in slope-intercept form.
            Since the y-intercept occurs when x=0, it is clear that the first term is also 0 and thus y=2.
            Similarly, since slope is only concerned with a change in value, the second term is the same whether x is 0 or 200.
            If we imagine moving from x to x+1, our y-value will from 3x + 2 to 3(x+1) + 2, a change of 3.
