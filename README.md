# The iJustine Challenge Math Problem Generator
## The "Official" Resource for Rule TBD

The text of rule TBD reads as follows:

>After each loading zone and before starting the next level, you must correctly answer a math question as generated on <a style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://clickster500.github.io/math_generator/">this website</a>. Must be shown on screen (either via screen capture or a live camera). Pen/pencil and paper is allowed, but calculators and any other outside resources are not. If you need additional help, instructions and practice are <a style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://clickster500.github.io/math_help/">available here</a>. Here is the <a style="color: red; test-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/Clickster500/Clickster500.github.io">source code</a>.

This project seeks to encourage a love of math in all future participants of the iJustine Challenge... Or instill fear.

Usage is straightforward: simply click the first link in the rule and follow the directions on the website.

## How it works

After reaching each loading zone, you simply click the continue button and a new problem will be generated for you. Each question is multiple choice, with 4 normal answers along with "none of the above." There is always a small chance (about 1/9) of getting a free pass, where you do not have to answer a question.

There are four different problem categories-- Arithmetic, Algebra I, Geometry or Basic Trig, and Basic Calculus. As you progress through the challenge, the chance of getting the first two will decrease and the the chance of getting the last two will increase.

There is no requirement to get all the questions right, but there is a time penalty for consecutive wrong answers. If you miss enough attempts in a row (at most, 15), the problem category will become easier. If even more attempts are missed, it will drop down to free pass. There is no fail condition for this rule.

If you are curious about any specific details, the source code is available in sources/math_problem_generator.js. I am happy to answer any questions. You can DM me on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/Clickster500">@Clickster500</a>), but I open twitter about once a month. I check my email much more frequently, clickster500@gmail.com.

## Additional Help

My primary goal for this rule was to encourage others to love math as much as I do. However, I still want this challenge to be accessible for those who do not have as much mathematical experience. That is why 1) there is no fail condition and 2) there is a page for help. Just click the second link in the rule.

This first goal of this page is practice. There is a modified version of the problem generator that allows you to focus on a single problem category. [This was also very helpful in debugging.]

The second goal is teaching. The rest of this page is dedicated to giving a broad overview of each category as well as enough specific information to answer each question type, without giving it away. The goal for this is to show someone both <i>how</i> to calculate the answer for a problem and what it <i>means</i> in a broader context.
